            <h2>"antidote"</h2>
            <p>Member of FloppaTools, allowing nazism and encouraging illegal content depicting children. Felt like putting him on here because hes a retarded kid that doesn't know how to code jack shit and pastes his entire code from ChatGPT.</p>

            <h2>"Stizzy Cat"</h2>
            <p>Another retard that can't code for shit and gatekeeps the most basic code in the known universe. Also a member of FloppaTools. Denies his face pic yet confesses to it in direct messages. Rookie move, Stizzy!</p>

            <h2>"client1979"</h2>
            <p>Another member of FloppaTools, I think you get the idea by this point. Multiple raids against our personal server and encouraging discriminatory language and the doxxing of minors.</p>

            <h2>FloppaTools</h2>
            <p>The center of attention in every situation, always has to get into beef with rival servers or their server is gonna be more dead than a raisin. Claims to have non-botted members while their server sits at 5,000 members and only staff chit-chat in the server, something not quite right here!</p>
